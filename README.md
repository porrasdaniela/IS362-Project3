# IS362-Project3

## Chinook Database Analysis

# Overview 
This project demonstrates how to connect to a relational database using Python and analyze data from the Chinook SQLite database, which simulates a digital music store. The analysis includes retrieving customer purchase data, performing SQL joins across multiple tables, and visualizing results using pandas and matplotlib.

# Objectives
- Connect to the Chinook SQLite database using Python

- Write and execute a SQL query that joins five related tables: Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, and Album

- Load the query results into a pandas DataFrame

- Analyze and visualize the top 10 most purchased tracks

- Demonstrate database interaction and data storytelling using Python

# Technologies Used
- SQLite (relational database)

- Python

- pandas

- matplotlib

- Jupyter Notebook

# Key Insights 
The project showcases how to extract meaningful data by combining information from different tables in a normalized database.

The most frequently purchased tracks were visualized, providing insight into customer preferences.

This analysis demonstrates the power of SQL combined with Python for effective data exploration.
